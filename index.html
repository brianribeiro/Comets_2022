            <p id="alert"><strong>When observing a comet please try to forget how bright you think the comet should be, what it was when you last viewed it, what other observers think it is or what the ephemeris says it should be.</strong></p>
            <p>The equations for the light curves of comets that are currently visible use only the raw observations and should give a reasonable prediction for the current brightness.  If the comet has not yet been observed or has gone from view a correction for aperture is included, so that telescopic observers should expect the comet to be fainter than given by the equation. The correction is about 0.033 per centimetre.  Values for the r parameter given in square brackets [ ] are assumed.  The form of the light curve is either the standard m = H0 + 5 log d + K0 log r or the linear brightening m = H0 + 5 log d + L0 abs(t - T + D0) where T is the date of perihelion, t the present and D0 an offset, if L0 is +ve the comet brightens towards perihelion and if D0 is +ve the comet is brightest prior to perihelion.</p>
            <p>Observations of <a href="https://people.ast.cam.ac.uk/~jds/2022obs.obs">new comets in 2022</a> are given in ICQ format.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Full details of recently discovered objects will not appear until they are available on the CBAT web pages.  The actual accuracy of preliminary orbits is often (nearly always) much worse than the published accuracy implies.&nbsp; In part this is because each orbital solution is treated as a mathematical construct and does not take account of observational error.&nbsp; <a href="http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi#top">JPL</a> does publish the errors, whereas the <a href="http://www.minorplanetcenter.org/mpec/RecentMPECs.html">MPECs</a> do not.</p>

                Kirsztian Sarneczky discovered a fast moving 18th magnitude comet at the Piszkesteto Observatory,
                Hungary in images taken with the 0.60-m Schmidt telescope on Jan. 2.11.  It was posted on the
                PCCP as Sar2585 and soon confirmed by other astrometrists.  [MPEC 2022-A59, CBET 5090, 2022 January 7]
                The comet is at perihelion in late January at 1.3 au and was discovered as it passed 0.3 au from Earth.

                PanSTARRS 2 discovered a 20th magnitude comet in images taken with the 1.8 m Ritchey-Chretien on
                January 10.62.   It was placed on the PCCP as P21q8AG. There were prediscovery images with the same telescope
                from the day before.
                [CBET 5093, MPEC 2022-C01, 2022 February 1]  The comet is at perihelion at 1.7 au in 2023 February.

                The ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) team discovered a 19th magnitude object
                in images taken with the 0.5m Schmidt at Mauna Loa on March 1.42.  It was posted on the PCCP as A10GhLU.
                Martin Tichy and other astrometrists reported signs of cometary activity. It was then linked to isolated tracklets
                reported from Mt Lemmon from January 10.43 into February, which the CBET says "should have been linked".
                Even earlier prediscovery Mt Lemmon images were then found from 2021 April and December.
                [MPEC 2022-E107, CBET 5106, 2022 March 7].  The comet is at perihelion at 3.7 au in 2023 September, but
                is not expected to get brighter than 16th magnitude.

                PanSTARRS 2 discovered an asteroid in images taken with the 1.8-m Ritchey-Chretien on
                2022 January 7.23.  It was placed on the PCCP as P21pW3D. [MPEC 2022-A185, 2022 January 14, though it remained
                on the PCCP until January 26]  The object, classified by JPL as a Centaur,
                was at perihelion at 2.3 au in 2021 November and is in a retrograde orbit with a period of around 40 years.

                A 21st magnitude object discovered with the DECam on the Cerro Tololo 4 m reflector was posted on the PCCP as IgJg1lf.
                [MPEC 2022-B91, 2022 January 28] It is classified by JPL as a Trans-Neptunian Object and has a period of around 400 years with perihelion
                at 4.9 au in 2022 January.

            <p>
                Kacper W Wierzchos discovered a comet of 20th magnitude in images taken with the 1.5-m
                reflector of the Mt Lemmon Survey on 2022 January 25.21.
                It was placed on the PCCP as C72JAA2.  There were pre-discovery PanSTARRS images from 2021 October and November.
                [MPEC 2022-C02, CBET 5094, 2022 February 1].  The comet is at perihelion at 1.9 au in 2022 February and has
                a period of around 13 years.  The comet will pass 0.5 au from Jupiter in 2046 February in an encounter that
                will increase the perihelion distance.

                The MPC identified a 21st magnitude object found in incidental astrometry from Mt Lemmon on January 25.51 and PanSTARRS 2
                on February 10.50 as being a return of 2017 R1.
                [CBET 5100, MPEC 2022-D03, 2022 February 16]  The comet is at perihelion at 3.3 au in 2025 September and has a period
                of 8.4 years.

            <p>
                A 22nd magnitude object was discovered on January 31.38 with the 2.25m Bok reflector at Kitt Peak.  It was posted on the
                PCCP as C09AWF5.  No cometary activity has been detected, however it is on a cometary type orbit.  [MPEC 2022-D24, 2022 February 21]
                The object was at perihelion in 2022 January at 3.7 au and is in a retrograde nearly parabolic orbit.

            <p>
                A 21st magnitude object was discovered on January 29.46 with the 2.25m Bok reflector at Kitt Peak during an NEO survey that is a
                collaboration between the Catalina Sky Survey and the University of Minnesota.  It was posted on the
                PCCP as C0996E5.  PanSTARRS reported cometary activity in images taken on February 2.  There were Mt Lemmon detections from
                shortly before the discovery observation.  [MPEC 2022-D33, CBET 5103, 2022 February 22/23]  There will almost certainly be
                a correction to the CBET as there are several typos, not least describing the nearly parabolic orbit of 2022 B3 as being "short-period".
                At discovery the comet was very close to perihelion at 1.4 au and is in a nearly parabolic orbit.

                Hirohisa Sato recovered 2011 Q3 at 20th magnitude in images taken with the 0.51-m f/6.8 iTelescope astrograph at Siding Spring on April 5.79, with confirming images taken with the same telescope five days later. [MPEC 2022-H01, CBET 5115, 2022 April 16/19].  The comet is at perihelion at 2.3 au in August.  Following the recovery Syuichi Nakano was able to link isolated observations made in 2000 by Spacewatch to the comet.  He notes that the comet passed 0.75 au from Jupiter in 1990 and 0.53 au in 2002, in encounters that made changes mostly to the angular elements.

                Alain Maury and Georges Attard discovered a comet, of 17th magnitude, in images taken with the 0.28 m Schmidt of the MAP Observatory, San Pedro de Atacama, Chile (W94) on 2022 May 5.38. It was placed on the PCCP as 2E42N21. Following posting on the PCCP it was independently discovered by NEOWISE. [MPEC 2022-J88, CBET 5121, 2022 May 11]. The comet was at perihelion at 1.6 au in 2022 February and has a retrograde orbit with a period of around 120 years. The MAP observatory is named for the initial letters of the last names of the amateur astronomers Alain Maury, Georges Attard and Daniel Parrot who own and run the observatory, which is dedicated to finding new asteroids and comets.  This is their fourth comet.
